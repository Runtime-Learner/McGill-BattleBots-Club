# MechEng curriculum.
Note: this info can be stored two ways. I've decided to make the following distinction:
1) Written tutorial (tut): Essentially a "textbook". A well-organized tutorial consisting of full sentences that teaches the student through written word.
2) Presenter's outline (notes): These are essentially slide notes. A reminder to the workshop presenter of the topics they should cover and the order to introduce them in in order to minimize confusion.

I initially set out to write a presenter's outline but found myself drifting into a written tutorial. In these early stages I really think we should develop presenter's outlines, and once we have oodles and oodles of time (as well as identified the need for them) we can create written tutorials. Or even Youtube tutorials. See, written tutorials might be invalidated by later decisions, but the presenter's outline will not change no matter what teaching medium we later choose. This is why we should create a presenter outline.

## M1: Overview of SolidWorks Principles
### Book Recommendation: SolidWorks Bible
Matt Lombard is a longtime SolidWorks writer and he knows the software inside and out. If you ever wish to get ahead of the curriculum and figure things out for yourself (or if you just need a written record of what happens in class, check out his documents: 
1. Mastering SolidWorks (2018)
2. SolidWorks Bible (2015) - interfaces might change here and there but it's still useable

## Navigating SolidWorks

### Part vs Assembly vs Sketch
This is the very first choice presented to you, so we'll start here.
- Assembly: a collection of parts
- Part: a physical body that does not consist of other parts

You can think of Parts as lego pieces, and Assemblies as collections of lego pieces, put together in specific ways. 
Note that 

### Reference Geometry
- Origin
- Front/Top/Right Planes
### Viewing your Model

## SolidWorks Paradigms

### 2D Sketch to 3D Object
- Primarily in SolidWorks you'll be sketching on a 2D plane and then "pushing" it into the 3rd dimension
    - the 2D plane can be extruded, extruded cut, revolved, swept, so many ways.
    - We'll cover more of this after the sketching section
    
### Parametric Modeling (e.g. Constraints)
- SolidWorks highly encourages defining geometry through logical relationships
    - e.g. can define a mirror 

### Sequence of Operations
- On the left side of SolidWorks is the "Rollback Bar" - it stores the larger things you've done and the order you've done it.
    - You have access to undo/redo while within doing things within sketch
    - But for larger operations, you use the rollback bar (sketches, features, extrusions)
    - This will be obvious: you'll be able to see what's on the rollback bar
    - SolidWorks remembers everything you did, in the order you did it.

Notes on the Rollback Bar:
- 
- Breaking something upstream sometimes break everything that happens afterwards
- Rollback bar allows you to jump forward and jump back
- However,
