# Workshop scheduling:
- one per week
- Some individual work to do between workshops

# Project based workshops:
## Workshop 1: Using Arduino: Electronic components. Resistors, capacitors, diodes, inductors
- Learning outcome: Basics of circuit analysis. Safety when working with electronics.
- Project: Timer circuit using capacitors and transistors. LED blinks at calculated interval time.
## Workshop 2: Using Arduino: Intro to Arduino. Control one LED. LED matrix. Working with registers and large LED matrices
- Learning outcome: Basics of Arduino programming (C programming, compiling code).
- Project: LED cube
## Workshop 3: Using Arduino: Buttons. Event based programming. Interrupts -> when and why to use them?
- Learning outcome: Advanced Arduino programming. Using interrupts for event detection
- Project idea 1: detecting button presses while running background tasks (maybe an infinite loop).
- Project idea 2: detecting button presses while running an LED blinking loop (no way to directly sample for button press)
