## First tutorial will be an introductory course
1. What is a microcontroller?
2. Why use one? (Software makes it easier to change behavior of machine)
3. It is possible to hardwire logic without the need for a microcontroller
4. Sensors (getters)
5. Motors and other peripherals (setters)
6. Phys 142. How much do you remember? --> kirchoff's laws, ohm's law, resistors, capacitors, inductors


# TIMELINE DRAFT 1
1. Intro. What is our process. Arduino -> why. Sensors and motors
2. Using Arduino: LED programming (turn on and off)
3. Using Arduino: LED matrix
4. Using Arduino: Buttons. Event based programming. Interrupts -> when and why to use them?
5. Using Arduino: Button matrix. Resistors and analog inputs
6. Using Arduino: Communication. use NRF24 to control LED
7. Motos and motor shields
8. Final workshop: end of bot build
