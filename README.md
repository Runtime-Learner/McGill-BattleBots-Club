# McGill-BattleBots-Club-Curriculum

## Target Audience
Most people who will attend the workshops will be beginners, but some will already have some experience with microcontrollers and robotics. Therefore, we should assume that we need to bring beginners up to level before being able to teach them with the rest of the members.

## First tutorial will be an introductory course
1. What is a microcontroller?
2. Why use one? (Software makes it easier to change behavior of machine)
3. It is possible to hardwire logic without the need for a microcontroller
4. Sensors (getters)
5. Motors and other peripherals (setters)
6. Phys 142. How much do you remember? --> kirchoff's laws, ohm's law, resistors, capacitors, inductors
