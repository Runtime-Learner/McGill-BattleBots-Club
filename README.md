# McGill-BattleBots-Club-Curriculum

## Target Audience
Most people who will attend the workshops will be beginners, but some will already have some experience with microcontrollers and robotics. Therefore, we should assume that we need to bring beginners up to level before being able to teach them with the rest of the members.

## First tutorial will be an introductory course
1. What is a microcontroller?
2. Why use one? (Software makes it easier to change behavior of machine)
3. It is possible to hardwire logic without the need for a microcontroller
4. Sensors (getters)
5. Motors and other peripherals (setters)
6. Phys 142. How much do you remember? --> kirchoff's laws, ohm's law, resistors, capacitors, inductors


# TIMELINE DRAFT
1. Intro. What is our process. Arduino -> why. Sensors and motors
2. Using Arduino: LED programming (turn on and off)
3. Using Arduino: LED matrix
4. Using Arduino: Buttons. Event based programming. Interrupts -> when and why to use them?
5. Using Arduino: Button matrix. Resistors and analog inputs
6. Using Arduino: Communication. use NRF24 to control LED
7. Motos and motor shields
8. Final workshop: end of bot build
